# About
Word processing code from [Alephbeis App](https://alephbeis.org/app/), where it is used for dynamic features such as Flashcards and Smart Sheets.
This code and related documentation has been taken directly from the [Alephbeis App](https://alephbeis.org/app/) without any modification. As such the code will obviously need to be adapted for any use.
Nonetheless, this might be useful for other projects, as such we have published it to the public domain for the use of those that might find this useful.
